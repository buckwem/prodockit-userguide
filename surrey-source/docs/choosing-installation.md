# Choose your install

Prodockit supports three installation paths. Choose the one that matches the
document and level of automation you have; the paths are alternatives rather
than stages to complete in sequence.

## Choose an installation path

\ref{fig-installation-approaches} helps you choose between a template site,
adopting Prodockit for a new or existing Zensical site, and a manual installation.

The three routes below compare their starting points and results in the same
order as the following sections.

<div class="grid cards installation-route-grid" markdown>

-   :lucide-rocket:{ .lg .middle } __Adopt prodockit__

    ---

    **Starting point:** an empty directory and no Zensical site.

    Create the Python environment, install Zensical, and prove that its local
    preview and strict build work. Then use Adoption to add Prodockit's
    authoring components, PDF support, and selected renderers without using
    the report template.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open section 4](getting-started.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary .installation-route-button }

-   :lucide-rocket:{ .lg .middle } __Build a template site__

    ---

    **Starting point:** a new computer, no existing site, or a project that
    should use the maintained report template.

    Bootstrap guides and verifies the machine setup, Git host, repository,
    project environment, build tools, and publishing configuration. The
    resulting site starts from `prodockit-template` and can later receive its
    maintained template updates.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open section 5](devcons/bootstrap.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary .installation-route-button }

-   :lucide-book-open:{ .lg .middle } __Build site manually__

    ---

    **Starting point:** a project whose author wants direct control of every
    installation decision and command.

    Prepare and verify the machine, repository, editor, Python environment,
    Zensical configuration, renderers, website, PDF, and source bundle
    yourself. This manual installation route explains all dependencies but
    does not use Bootstrap or Adoption to orchestrate them.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open section 6](manual-install.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary .installation-route-button }

</div>

These routes are alternatives, not stages in a longer sequence. Choose only
one. In particular, do not run Bootstrap merely because an adopted or manually
built project later needs PDF support.

Every route starts with [Prepare to install](installation.md). That shared
preparation establishes the supported Python and a setup environment in the
directory holding your repositories. Your chosen route then explains when to
enter or create the project and activate its project-specific environment.
